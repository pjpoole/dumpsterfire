### Work

By day, I am a [software developer][professional] with a strong preference for back-end technologies. My tenacious nature lends itself well to bug-fixing, performance, and security issues, as well as writing clean code with clear responsibilities.

### Interests

I write for fun. I don't like having my output stored on someone else's platform and hosted at their whims; frustrations with the entropy of sites like Facebook drove me to finally setup a this site as a hobby project/creative release valve.

What I do with my time:

- Read, mostly sci-fi and political science
- Watching movies, playing games...
Anything involving tropes, oddly enoughâ€”I like thinking about the relationships between superficially dissimilar media, and recognizing patterns. Watching movies with me can be a uniquely exhausting experience

Things that I don't do as often as I'd like:

- Riding my bike
- Cooking elaborate dishes, or trying to perfect simple recipes (e.g. french bread)
- Learn languages
- DIY projects around the house

### Personal

I live on the Upper East Side of New York with my wife, and our cat <del>fat head</del> Alan.
